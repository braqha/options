  <h1>What are Options?</h1>
  <!-- test -->
  <p><strong>Options</strong> are contracts that give you the right, <em>but not the obligation,</em> to buy 100 shares of an underlying stock or ETF at a designated strike price.
  </p>

  <p>
  Because of this, options have the intrinsic value of potentially giving investors better entry points into positions on an underlying or exit points out of positions on an underlying. However, options also have extrinsic value in the form of time to expiration and implied volatility, both variables that help determine an options potential to become "in the money".

      Option contracts have greek variables that help to determine different things about them.
      These variables are:
      <ol>
          <li>Delta</li>
          <li>Theta</li>
          <li>Gamma</li>
          <li>Vega</li>
      </ol>
